        #  Disabled: Windows*
        #
        #  Two JDK issues are annoying enough to disable the Watch Service on Windows for now:
        #  - JDK-7052697: Windows locks watched directories so parents of watched directories can't be renamed
        #  - JDK-6972833: Windows does not close the file descriptor of a watched directory fast enough, so
        #                 directories can't be removed as long as they contain child directories
        #
        #  Disabled: Mac OS X
        #
        #  There is no native implementation of WatchService for Mac OS X yet.
